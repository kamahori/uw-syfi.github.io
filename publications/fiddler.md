## Overview

Fiddler is a specialized inference system designed to run large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in resource-constrained environments where GPU memory is insufficient to hold the full model. Existing methods rely on offloading model weights to CPU memory and transferring them to the GPU on-demand, which is severely bottlenecked by the limited PCIe bandwidth. Fiddler challenges this paradigm by demonstrating that for single-batch, latency-critical inference, it is often faster to **execute expert layers directly on the CPU** rather than transferring their weights to the GPU.

## Core Innovations

### 🎻 CPU-GPU Orchestration

The core innovation of Fiddler is its ability to dynamically orchestrate computation between the CPU and GPU based on resource availability and performance characteristics:

- **Compute-Centric Offloading**: Instead of moving heavy expert weights (GBs) to the GPU, Fiddler moves the much smaller activation data (MBs) to the CPU for computation.
- **Latency-Aware Decision Making**: The system analyzes the trade-off between data transfer latency and computation latency to determine the optimal execution path for each layer.
- **Resource Synergy**: Utilizes the often-idle CPU computational power to assist the GPU, effectively expanding the hardware capabilities for inference.

### ⚡ Minimized Data Movement

Fiddler fundamentally changes the data movement patterns in MoE inference:

- **Weight Retention**: Keeps large expert weights in CPU RAM, avoiding the high latency of moving them over PCIe.
- **Activation Transfer**: Transfers only the necessary activation tensors between GPU and CPU, which is significantly faster due to their small size (e.g., batch size $\times$ hidden dimension).
- **Expert Locality**: Non-expert layers (attention, dense) typically remain on the GPU, while sparse expert layers are routed to the CPU when GPU memory is full.

### 🔧 Optimized CPU Kernels

- Custom optimized kernels for expert layer computation on CPUs.
- Efficient thread management to maximize CPU core utilization during expert execution.
- Synergistic scheduling that overlaps GPU non-expert computation with CPU expert computation where possible.

## Performance Benchmarks

Fiddler demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art offloading systems:

### Key Results
- **>3 tokens/second** generation speed for unquantized Mixtral-8x7B on a single 24GB GPU.
- **8.2x - 10.1x speedup** in single-batch inference latency compared to standard offloading methods.
- Enables running >90GB models on devices with limited GPU memory without severe performance penalties.

## System Architecture

Fiddler's architecture is designed to bridge the gap between memory capacity and compute capability:

1. **Model Partitioner**: Splits the MoE model into GPU-resident components (attention layers, gate networks) and CPU-resident components (expert weights).
2. **Orchestration Engine**: At runtime, the engine intercepts expert layer calls. It checks if the required experts are on the GPU. If not, it seamlessly transfers activations to the CPU.
3. **Hybrid Execution Pipeline**: 
    - **GPU**: Handles attention mechanisms and hot experts (if caching is used).
    - **CPU**: Handles the "long tail" of diverse experts that cannot fit in GPU memory.
    - **PCIe Bus**: Used strictly for lightweight activation transfer rather than heavy weight swapping.

This design eliminates the "PCIe wall" that typically freezes inference while waiting for weights to load, ensuring a smooth and continuous token generation process.

## Key Takeaways

**Data movement is the primary bottleneck for local LLM inference**, especially for sparse models like MoE where only a fraction of parameters are used per token.

**Compute is often cheaper than communication**. Fiddler proves that it is more efficient to perform calculations on a slower processor (CPU) where the data resides, rather than moving massive amounts of data to a faster processor (GPU). This "shipping compute to data" approach unlocks the ability to serve massive models on consumer-grade or single-GPU hardware with acceptable interactive performance.
