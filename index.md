The SyFI Lab at the University of Washington builds efficient and resilient infrastructure for the future of AI. As applications grow more complex, we bridge the gap between next-gen models and heterogeneous hardware through cross-stack innovation, delivering scalable, open-source systems validated by industrial partners.

Our research targets three key areas:
- **Efficient AI**: Optimizing algorithms and systems to maximize performance for training and inference.
- **Flexible AI**: Architecting systems that seamlessly adapt to diverse tasks, strategies, and model structures.
- **Resilient AI**: Ensuring AI system reliability at scale while leveraging AI to improve infrastructure robustness.
