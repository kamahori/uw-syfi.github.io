ICML 2024 in Vienna was an extraordinary experience for our team. Not only did we present our work on disaggregated AI systems, but we also had the privilege of delivering a keynote on the future of AI infrastructure. Here are our key takeaways from this remarkable conference.

## Our Presentation: Disaggregated AI Systems

Our paper "Disaggregated AI: Rethinking Model Architecture for Heterogeneous Systems" generated significant interest and discussion. The core idea – that AI models can be decomposed into specialized, dynamically activatable components – resonated strongly with the community.

### Key Results

- **40% Memory Reduction:** Our disaggregated approach consistently reduced memory requirements across various model architectures
- **25% Inference Speedup:** Dynamic component selection led to faster inference times for most practical workloads
- **Heterogeneous Deployment:** Successful deployment across diverse hardware configurations from edge devices to data center GPUs

## Community Response and Discussions

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with several key themes emerging from our discussions with other researchers:

### Sustainability Focus

Many researchers expressed excitement about the environmental implications of our work. The ability to reduce computational requirements while maintaining performance aligns perfectly with the community's growing focus on sustainable AI.

### Industry Adoption Potential

We had fascinating conversations with industry practitioners who saw immediate applications for disaggregated AI in their production systems. The flexibility to adapt to different deployment constraints was particularly appealing.

### Technical Challenges

Researchers also raised important questions about:
- Component interdependency management
- Dynamic orchestration overhead
- Training procedures for disaggregated systems

## Emerging Trends We Observed

### 1. Efficiency and Sustainability

ICML 2024 showcased a clear shift towards efficiency-conscious AI research. From our disaggregated systems to pruning techniques and efficient architectures, the community is seriously addressing the computational and environmental costs of AI.

### 2. Heterogeneous Computing

Multiple presentations highlighted the importance of designing AI systems for diverse hardware landscapes. Our work fits perfectly into this trend, providing a framework for adaptive deployment across heterogeneous infrastructure.

### 3. Modular AI Architectures

We weren't alone in exploring modular approaches. Several other works presented complementary ideas about composable AI systems, suggesting this is becoming a major research direction.

## Networking and Collaborations

Beyond the technical presentations, ICML provided invaluable networking opportunities. We initiated collaborations with:

- **European Research Groups:** Partners interested in sustainable AI computing initiatives
- **Industry Labs:** Companies looking to implement disaggregated AI in production environments
- **Hardware Vendors:** Organizations developing specialized AI accelerators that could benefit from modular deployment strategies

## What's Next

ICML 2024 energized our research agenda. Based on the feedback and discussions, we're focusing on:

- **Standardization Efforts:** Working towards common interfaces for disaggregated AI components
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Developing comprehensive benchmarks for modular AI systems
- **Tool Development:** Building practical tools to make disaggregated AI accessible to practitioners

The conference reinforced our belief that the future of AI lies not just in larger models, but in smarter, more adaptable architectures. We're excited to continue this journey and grateful for the vibrant research community that makes conferences like ICML so valuable.
